# Learning to Evade: Statistical Learning-Based Adaptive Attacks Towards Audio Watermarking

This paper has been submitted to Usenix Security 2026 Cycle 1 for peer reviewing.

# How to Use
## Dependencies
```
conda create -n AWM python=3.9.21
conda activate AWM
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Dataset
For the attack, we only provide the code and data for the watermark replacement attack for now. We will publish the complete code after the paper is accepted or release the complete code upon request.
The dataset is aviable on . You can conduct the experiments using the provided data in this link.

**audioseal_replacement**: the data for the watermark replacement attack. "baseline" data is generated from AudioMarkBench; "my_method" data is generated from AWM; "my_method_optimization" data is generated from AWM (+opt).
